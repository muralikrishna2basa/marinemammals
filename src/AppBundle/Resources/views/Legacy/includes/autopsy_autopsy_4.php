<h3>Small Cetaceans</h3>

<p>For cetaceans that are easily transportable, it would be easier to perform necropsy in dissection or necropsy room.

Particularities and differences for small cetacean necropsy are presented hereafter.</p>

<h3>External examination</h3>

<p>Photographs should be taken of <span  id='lateral'>lateral view</span>, more particularly for the presence of <span  id='netmark'>netmarks</span> on the head, around rostrum and flippers. Pictures of <span  id='dorsal'>the dorsal fin</span> can be helpful for animal identification.</p>

<p>Body lengths (see annex ) are <span  id='measured'>measured</span> by placing tape next to the carcass (laying ventrally) in a straight line parallel to the longitudinal body axis.   The total body length is taken from most cranial point of the rostrum to the notch in the tail fluke. <span  id='blubber1'>The blubber thickness</span> is measured after skin and blubber incision, vertically from the cranial insertion of the dorsal fluke to the ventral midline.</p>

<p><span  id='penis'>Externally, the penis is not visible,</span> being wrapped in a subcutaneous sheath (preputial pouch), staying in the pouch by the contraction of a S-curvature. To examine the penis, it is necessary to pull it or to open the preputial pouch.</p>

<h3>Abdominal and thoracic cavity opening</h3>

<p>For practical reason, it is easier to open the animal by the left flank, the cetacean laying on its right and to open abdominal and thoracic cavities together. To <span  id='cavities'>open the cavities</span>, one incision is made horizontally through the skin and the blubber, along the lateral processes of vertebrae from the head to the anus level. Two other incisions are made vertically from the first incision to the ventral midline, one between head and neck, one to the anus. The strip of skin and blubber is removed. To open the abdominal cavity, the landmark to find is the caudal <span  id='extremity'>extremity</span> of the last rib. The extremity is pulled up and the abdominal wall can be opened by cutting muscles vertically along the last rib, without damage for intra-abdominal organs and caudally to the anus. The left thoracic breastplate is removed in one piece, dissecting the articulations between ribs and vertebrae and ribs and sternum. A rib can be collected for toxicology. Such opening allows to have a <span  id='general'>general overview</span> of the topography and the organs in situ.</p>

<p>The examination of abdominal and thoracic organs and samplings of procedure are similar to what it is described in the general procedure.</p>

<h3>Neck and head</h3>

<p>The skin and subcutaneous tissues are removed ventrally from the intermandibular space up to the entry of the thorax. After examination and sampling of tissues (tongue, esophagus, trachea, thyroid, thymus), the head is separated from the rest of the body by dissection of the atlanto-occipital articulation. The lower jaw is separated and teeth (at least 4) are collected at the middle of the lower jaw and stored frozen for age determination. The acoustic fat (within the mandible) is examined in situ and <span  id='lowercut'>the lower jaw is cut</span> at the middle to detect any evidence of haemorrhage or acoustic fat bleeding. Acoustic fat is collected for histology.</p>

<h3>Ear extraction and fixation protocol</h3>

<p>TYMPANIC-PERIOTIC COMPLEX</p>

<p>The tympanic and periotic bones house the middle and inner ear, respectively. These structures are partially fused forming the tympanic-periotic complex (Figure 1). The tympanic-periotic complex is surrounded by aerial sinuses called peribullar sinuses and suspended in the peribullar cavity through ligaments that hold it fixed and acoustically isolated it from the rest of the bones of the skull, except the sperm whales and some beaked whales who present the tympanic-periotic complex partially fused to the temporal bone.</p>

<h4>Extraction</h4>

<p>1.- With small specimens, it is recommended to cut the head of the animal for an easier manipulation (Figure 2).</p>

<p>Figure 2.- The position of the tympanic-periotic complex and auditory external meatus is indicated. The dotted line marks the incision path to separate the head from the rest of the body. Alternatively, the digestive system can be extracted from the head to facilitate the access to the ears.</p>

<p>2.- Taking into account the localization of the tympanic-periotic complex (Figures 3 and 4), the easiest way to access the ears is to carefully remove the lower jaw.</p>

<p>Figure 3.- Sagital cut of a bottlenose dolphin head where the location of the tympanic-periotic complex is indicated.</p>

<p>3.- Situating the head in a ventral position and removing the soft tissues and ligaments (Figure 4) allows to proceed to the tympanic-periotic complex extraction.</p>

<p>Figure 4.- Image taken during the necropsy of a   Phocoena phocoena . This image reflects how the tympanic-periotic complex appears after removing the lower jaw (no effort has been made here to clean the area of extraction)</p>

<p>4.- Incise gently around the tympanic-periotic complex with a small knife (a scalpel can be used for the final stage of the extraction) to cut the ligaments that mantain the ears in the paraotic sinus (see Figure 5).</p>

<p>Figure 5.- Image taken during a Phocoena phocoena necropsy. The dotted line illustrates the location where the knife should be placed to extract the tympanic-periotic complex.</p>

<h4>Fixation</h4>

<p>5a.- At that stage, the ear could be fixed simply placing it in a fixative solution:   glutaraldehyde 2,5% with phosphate buffer 0,1M 2 or a mixture of paraformaldehyde 0,5% with glutaraldehyde 1% with phosphate buffer 0,1M 3 . If the mentioned fixative solutions are lacking, the tissues can be also fixed with formaldehyde 10%.</p>

<p>However, for a better result we recommend to follow the protocol described in point 5b.</p>

<p>5b.- If already experienced with the injection protocol, you may want to progressively and very slowly introduce the fixative solution (glutaraldehyde 2,5% with phosphate buffer 0,1M or a mixture of paraformaldehyde 0,5% with glutaraldehyde 1% with phosphate buffer 0,1M) through the oval window (after removing the stapes and making a small and superficial hole in both windows) and the round window (Figure 6) using a soft catheter from the same diameter as the windows size (Figure 7).</p>

<p>If the above fixative solutions are lacking, the ears can alternatively be injected with formaldehyde 10%.</p>

<p>The injection is a very delicate process and if you do not feel comfortable with it, please do not perform it. It is important to mention if the ear has been injected or not when sending it. In any case, before performing the injection, you are welcome to contact the Laboratori d'Aplicacions Bioac&uacute;stiques.</p>

<p>Figure 7.- Tursiops truncatus   periotic bone   used to illustrate all the steps in the injection process: A) cut of the stapedial ligament, B) removal of the stapes, C and D) the performance of a little a superficial hole in the oval and round windows respectivelly, E and F) introduction of the fixative solution progressively and very slowly (very little pressure)   through the oval window and the round window using a soft catheter from the same diameter as the windows size, until the solution gets out through the other one for some seconds.</p>

<p>6.- Place the ears in jars that contain the fixative liquids (see point 6).</p>

<h3>Brain or central nervous system tissue</h3>

<p>If spinal cord sample is necessary (histology or microbiology), it can be collected after the head separation within the atlas vertebrae. To have access to the brain, <span  id='skull'>the skull is sawed</span> longitudinally. The blowhole and the nasal passage can be examined for the presence of parasite, liquid or foam. The pituitary gland (mid-ventral part of the brain, in the Sella turcica ) is sampled separately for histology. A complete <span  id='cerebral'>cerebral hemisphere</span> is collected for histology while the other hemisphere is sampled for virology, toxicology and bacteriology.</p>

<p>The peritympannic sinuses are dissected and examined for the presence of parasites and fluid.</p>

<p>To prepare 1 l of glutaraldehyde 2,5% is necessary to dilute 100 ml of concentrate solution (glutaraldehyde 25%) in 900ml of phosphate buffer 0,1M, prepared following this mixture: 3,12 g of NaH 2 PO 4 2H 2 O (PM =156 g) in 100 ml distilled water 28,64 g of Na 2 HPO 4 &middot; 12 H 2 O (PM= 358 g) in 400 ml distilled water Add 500ml of distilled water to the mixture</p>

<p>
Please, be aware that once these products are mixed, the fixative power is active for around a week; so it's better to keep them separately and do the mixture at the last moment.</p>
