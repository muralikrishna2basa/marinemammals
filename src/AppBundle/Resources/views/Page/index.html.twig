    <h2>The Belgian marine mammal database</h2>

<div class="col-lg-10">
    <p>
        This website contains information about marine mammals in Belgium: from sightings to strandings and the
        results of scientific research.
        It includes data about dolphins, whales and seals from Belgian waters, but also some data from neighbouring
        countries (France, the Netherlands) is included. </p>
    <p>
        The marinemammals.be database was set up as a joint venture between the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural
        Sciences (RBINS), Directorate Natural Environment, and the department
        of Veterinary Pathology (VP) of the University of Li√®ge.
    </p>

    <p>
        Collecting data on strandings and sightings of marine mammals is important as such data can can provide us
        with a lot of information about marine mammals, their population trends, problems they face, and eventually
        on the condition of the marine environment in general.
        Until some decades ago, only few data were collected from stranded animals. Nowadays, full necropsies are
        performed, and tissue samples are collected for research purposes.
    </p>

    <p>
        Two access levels exist in this website:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>An open access level, with contains the data on strandings and observations, meant for the general public.
        </li>
        <li>A restricted access level, that leads to the tissue collection. The data available here will mostly be
            of interest to researchers. From these pages, the different tissue samples and the way to obtain these can be browsed.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>The main contents of the different web pages are:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>(Open access): Observations and strandings of marine mammals in Belgium; queries can be made of species,
            year, circumstances, etc. Pictures and video images are available in some cases.
        </li>
        <li>
            (Open access): A description of the methodology for the post-mortem investigation of stranded and
            bycaught animals.
        </li>
        <li>
            (Restricted access): The tissue bank page provides for access to more than 25.000 (mostly) tissue
            samples taken from marine mammals. Queries can be performed for species, type of tissue, method of
            storage, etc. In order to access this page, you need to be a registered user.
        </li>
    </ul>
