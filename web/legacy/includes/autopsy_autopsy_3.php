<h3>G&eacute;n&eacute;ral Procedure</h3>

<p>A necropsy <span  id='reference'>reference</span> number or code (one and only one) should be given for every animal, and the reference should be present on every samples collected. All organs must be carefully examined and sliced, ideally at regular intervals.   Lesions must be described before and after incision (taking into account shape, colour, content, consistence, aspect,...), sampled (see below) and photographed with a ruler indicating the size and the necropsy reference of the animal.   In addition to lesions, some tissues are systematically collected for histopathological, parasitological, bacteriological, virological, toxicological and live history investigations (see annex 3).   This sampling can be performed without accurate order but tissues for bacteriology, virology and electron microscopy should be collected as soon as possible.   In addition, to prevent contamination by micro-organisms from intestine, intestinal tract should be left intact until last.</p>

<h3>External examination</h3>

<p>Body condition is estimated using condition code (see table 3).   Photographs should be taken of lateral view, more particularly of the head, body openings and external lesions.</p>

<p>Nutritional status is evaluated taking into account the blubber thickness and the muscle aspect; a bad nutritional state being characterized by a thin blubber layer and muscle atrophy (hallow aspect lateral to dorsal fin and protusion of lateral processes of lumbar vertebrae).</p>

<p>Skin is carefully examined for lesions and ectoparasites, particularly around body openings.   Special attention should be paid to any scars (precise description with photographs, localisation, number, size,...) allowing animal's identification.   A skin sample is taken for live history.</p>

<p>Body openings including <span  id='mouth'>mouth </span>(tongue, palate, teeth or baleen plates), <span  id='eye'>eyes</span>, blow-hole(s), ear openings, genital slit and anus are examined, and any lesions, parasites or discharges are described and sampled.   Pictures are taken when needed.   In female, mammary glands are examined and sampled for histopathology.   When present, milk is collected for toxicology and biochemistry. In neonates, the umbilicus is examined and collected for histology.</p>

<h3>Abdominal cavity opening</h3>

<p><span  id='blubber'>The blubber and its interfaces</span> with skin and muscle are particularly investigated for the presence of parasites and parasite cysts.   Some of these cysts have nearly the same colour as blubber fat and are not easily identified.   Sampling for toxicology should be done at the caudal insertion of dorsal fin and should be performed when blubber thickness is measured.</p>

<p>Muscle is collected for toxicology (heavy metals and organochlorines) below the place of blubber sample (same place, same time).</p>

<p>The peritoneum is particularly investigated for the presence of parasites and parasite cysts.</p>

<p>Bacteriological and virological samples from abdominal organs should be collected as soon as the abdominal cavity is opened, with the exception of the intestine. Frequently, the gastrointestinal tract, dilated by putrefaction gases, protrudes out through the opening of the abdomen.   In such case, incisions are made along the greater curvature of stomach compartments.   The intestine is ligatured cranially close to the stomach and removed by dissection of mesentery.   Care should be taken as the intestinal tract is easily torn.</p>

<p><span  id='Liver'>The liver</span> is observed in situ on both side and sampled (toxicology -heavy metals and organochlorines, histopathology, virology, parasitology).   The organ is then sliced for internal examination, at regular intervals, and the bile ducts are examined for the presence of parasites.</p>

<p><span  id='kidney'>The kidneys</span> are observed in situ , sliced at regular intervals and sampled (toxicology -heavy metals and organochlorines, histopathology, virology, parasitology) including complete reniculi with renal medulla and cortex.   Renal tissue and blood vessels are particularly examined for the presence of parasites.</p>

<p>The urinary bladder is observed in situ and sampled for histopathology.   Content is described (volume, colour,...) and should be collected at lower part of the bladder for parasitological examination (parasite eggs).</p>

<p><span  id='gastric'>The gastric compartments</span> are opened along <span  id='greater'>greater curvature</span> and content is directly collected (life history and parasitology).   The stomach can be rinsed with water and the content sieved to collect the smaller parts (otolithe). Particular attention should be taken for the presence of <span  id='parasite'>parasites</span>, lesions, otolithes, fishbones and cephalopod's beaks between gastric folds.</p>

<p>The testis are examined in situ , sliced and sampled for life history.</p>

<p>The ovaries are examined in situ , sliced and sampled for life history.   Note any corpora lutea or albicantia or follicles on each ovary.</p>

<p>The uterus is opened and examined.   In pregnant females, the foetus is examined and sampled according to the dissection protocol.</p>

<p>The adrenals (not easily observed) should be collected for histopathology.   Particular attention should be draw for cysts. Cysts content should be collected (sterile syringe and needle) and kept frozen (-20&deg;C) for biochemical analyses.</p>

<p><span  id='pancreas'>The pancreas</span> is examined and pancreatic ducts are particularly examined for the presence of parasites. Tissue samples for histopathology need to be taken as soon as possible, as this organ is affected severely by decomposition.</p>

<p><span  id='spleen'>The spleen</span> and <span  id='mesenteric'>the mesenteric lymph nodes</span> are examined and sampled for histopathology and virology.</p>

<p>The intestine should be examined last, outside of the abdominal cavity.   Any lesion and all parasites should be carefully examined and collected.   Intestinal content is described when present.   Ligatured segments are collected for bacteriology and parasitology.</p>

<h3>Thoracic cavity opening</h3>

<p>If the skeleton is to be preserved, the opening of the thoracic cavity requires the detachment of the ribs from the vertebrae and from the sternum. As soon as possible, during this operation, samples for bacteriology, virology and electron microscopy should be collected.   If skeleton is not to be preserved, ribs can be sawn through.</p>

<p><span  id='thoracic'>In the thoracic cavity</span>, organs should be examined in situ , and after, the respiratory systems with the heart, major blood vessels and esophagus are removed from the thoracic cavity.</p>

<p><span  id='lung'>The lungs</span> are examined, carefully described (size, colour, consistence, aspect,...) and sampled (histopathology, bacteriology and virology).   Tissue is sliced at regular intervals and cut surface is examined for the presence of liquids (blood, serous,...) or foam oozing from parenchyma.   Any parasite is collected.</p>

<p>The bronchioles, <span  id='bronchi'>bronchi</span> and <span  id='trachea'>trachea</span> are examined and the lumen content, if present, is described.   Any parasite is collected.</p>

<p><span  id='heart'>The heart</span> is separated from the lungs by cutting the major vessels.   Blood is collect from the heart lumen, from major vessels or from elsewhere for virology, for parasitology (blood parasites), for toxicology and for biochemistry.   Left and right ventricles, and atria are opened and heart tissue is collected for histopathology.   Any parasite is collected.</p>

<p>All major blood vessels are examined and any parasite is collected.</p>

<h3>Neck and head</h3>

<p><span  id='lowerjaw'>The lower jaw</span> is dissected and cut at mandibular articulation (to be performed finally).   The hyoid bones are cut close to the skull.   By this way, all the buccal cavity can be examined as well as basis of the tongue with the tonsil area and larynx.</p>

<p>Dissection of this area allows examination of larynx, trachea and oesophagus. Oesophagus should be observed entirely for the presence of preys.   When fishes are present, their orientation (head fish to stomach or to buccal cavity) must be specified.
Dissection of tissue overlying trachea allows identification of <span  id='thyroid'>thyroid gland and thymus</span> (not easily observed).   They are examined and sampled (histopathology).</p>
