            <p class="Text">With a maximum length of 1.8m, the porpoise is the smallest cetacean found in the North Sea.
                After decades of almost total absence, this marine mammal has again become fairly common in Belgian
                waters since the second half of the 1990s. Porpoises are often observed here especially in the spring
                (January to May). The number of stranded animals has also been increasing for some time now. Between
                1990 and 1996, three to six stranded porpoises were reported every year. From 1997 to 2004, this figure
                rose to 40 (in 2004) a year. </p>

            <p class="Text">On 14 December 2004, Eric Stienen from the Institute of
                Nature Conservation observed a dead minke whale, a few kilometres off
                the coast of Nieuwpoort. It was taken on board of the &quot;Zeehond&quot;
                and brought on land. The young female minke whale was 4,20m long. She
                was still in a good condition. </p>

            <p class="Text">Minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) live in all oceans
                and seas. They are the smallest and most common whale of the northern
                North sea. Minke whales are rarely seen in the southern part of the North
                sea, at our coast. They eat small pelagic fish such as herring.</p>

            <p class="Text">There are only 3 known strandings of minke whales in Belgium:
                Blankenberge (1931), in the Scheldt, Hemiksem (1865) and in Blankenberge
                (1837). In the Netherlands there have been a few strandings in the last
                years. </p>

            <p class="Text">Scientists of the University of Li&egrave;ge carried out
                an autopsy to try and find the cause of death. Their observations were
                very clear: the animal showed fish net marks on the outside. The whale
                drowned in a fishing net. The animal was not very healthy: its fat layer
                was too thin. In the stomach of the whale, scientists found 27 kg of fresh
                fish.</p>

                live cetacean at sea in the vicinity of Blankenberge. Observers

                as a sperm whale (<i>Physeter macrocephalus</i>), apparently in
                a very bad physical health. The animal was last seen on the same
                day off the port of Zeebrugge. Just one month later a decayed carcass
                of a sperm whale washed ashore in the Netherlands. The same individual?

                whale washed ashore at Koksijde. The lower jaw of the animal had

                with marine mammal strandings. This made clear that the animal had
                already washed ashore a month earlier at Thornham, Norfolk (UK).
                There its lower jaw was cut off, and the animal was taken away again

            bottom set gill nets?</u>

            <p class="Text">On the 8th of March, a young
                female harbour porpoise stranded at the Belgian coast near Koksijde.
                The porpoise drowned, probably during the night of 7 - 8 March.
                The evidence of drowning was very obvious: the well-nourished animal
                showed clear net-markings on head and fins. Most probably it died
                in one of the bottom set gill nets which are deployed in shallow
                water. Recreational fishermen set these nets on the beach and in
                the shallow sea at low tide. </p>

            <p class="Text">Harbour porpoises are the smallest of dolphins occurring
                in the North Sea. They used to be common along the shores of Belgium
                up to the 1960'ies. It is a threatened species. Most common threats
                are pollution, disturbance and bycatch in fishing gear. During the
                last years (since 1998) more harbour porpoises have been sighted
                in the southern North Sea. The pictures show the animal and a detail
                of a net marking on its snout. </p></td>

            in the north of France</u>

            <p class="Text">On the 4th of March 2001
                a live striped dolphin (<i>Stenella coeruleoalba</i>) stranded near
                Audresselles in the North of France. The very weak animal was transported
                to the aquarium of Nausicaa, Boulogne, where it received first attention.
                From there MUMM transported it to The Netherlands with the aid of
                the special stretcher. Halfway, in an excellently co-ordinated effort,
                the animal was transferred to the care of the veterinary surgeon
                of the rehabilitation centre based at the dolphinarium of Harderwijk,
                The Netherlands. This centre specialises in the rehabilitation of
                stranded dolphins and porpoises. Unfortunately, the striped dolphin
                died on March 13. Striped dolphins are very rare in the North Sea.
                From the Belgian coast only one stranding is known. This is the
                second stranding of a striped dolphin in the North of France during
                the last few weeks<br>

            in Belgium</u></p>

            <p class="Text">On the 19th of December 2000, in the late afternoon,
                a male leatherback turtle (<i>Dermochelys coriacea</i>) stranded
                near Ostend, Belgium. The animal measured 194 cm (body length) and
                weighed around 375 kg. It was alive when it stranded, but clearly
                in a very weak condition. It was taken to Sea Life Blankenberge,
                where it died a couple of hours later.</p>

            <p class="Text">From the animal a cast was made, and it was autopsied
                on Friday the 22nd of December by the University of Li&egrave;ge.
                The autopsy revealed that a ship's propeller probably hit the animal,
                some days before the stranding occurred. Two parallel, deep wounds
                were found on the ventral side of the carapace. </p>

            <p class="Text">This was only the third recorded stranding of a leatherback
                turtle in Belgium. The first concerned a decomposed carapace that
                washed ashore in December 1988. The second animal (September 1998)
                probably entered Belgian waters alive, but it was probably cut in
                two by a ship's propeller.</p></td>
